// Three things live here, in the order a row count is arrived at: the
// capacity estimate (the table below), the trim a widget is known to shed
// under it, and fitList, the one operation every list renderer asks its
// question through.

// setMoreBadge is the corner count's only writer, and a fit is the only thing
// that knows what a card left out, so the stamp happens here rather than in
// every renderer that slices a list. card.js reaches config.js, which reaches
// layout.js, which reaches back here; nothing in that ring runs at module
// scope, so the cycle resolves before any of it is called.

// Every list renderer used to assemble the answer itself out of the same four
// moves (read the card's size, ask the model, clamp what the model said, then
// slice and draw), and the clamp is exactly where nineteen call sites drifted
// into six dialects: Math.max(1, ...) on the four rail boards, `?? 4` on five
// more, `?? 5` on services, nothing at all on seven, and PATH writing a
// compound of all three at once. Four widgets went further and measured the
// drawn box, in two copies of one shrink-grow-squeeze walk that only two of
// them had tests for.
//
// So the protocol is one call, and the dialects become arguments:
//
//   id          the widget's own meta.id, which is the capacity model's key.
//   items       the list being sliced. Optional: a widget that spends the
//               count as a BUDGET rather than slicing one list (bus shares it
//               between stop headers and arrivals, PATH between two direction
//               sections) has no single total to measure against.
//   draw(n, squeezed)  render n items into the body. Called once for the
//               estimate, and again for every step of the measured walk.
//   defaultSize the size to assume when there is no card to read one from
//               (tests render into bare divs; see cardSize).
//   min         the floor under the estimate, and the row the shed loop will
//               never take. This is the Math.max idiom.
//   fallback    what to draw when the model has no entry for this id. This is
//               the `??` idiom.
//   reserve     rows the card spends on something other than items before it
//               counts any (PATH's per-section labels).
//   measure     also run the shed loop against the drawn box.
//   squeeze     ...and, having shrunk, grow back into whatever room is left,
//               then spend the last of it on one row drawn short. Growing and
//               squeezing arrive together because they are one appetite: fill
//               the card. The two shrink-only callers must not grow: subway
//               settled its priority order against the estimate and would
//               start dealing rows it had already ruled out, and F1's columns
//               have no more rows to deal.
//   slack       pixels of overflow to tolerate before shedding. F1 shipped
//               with one of them; unifying it to zero would cost a standings
//               row on a hairline overflow.
//   badge       stamp the corner count with what the fit left out. Off unless
//               asked, because three families count something else: the rail
//               boards count after their own measured fit, the news family
