// clipping the tail. Bottom rung is 20px alert text: exactly what the CARD
// already asks a reader to take, never less.

// not fit past it — 27px of a twelve-alert meltdown on the 854px harness canvas,
// and 67px once that canvas was corrected to the board's real 814. A third
// column costs no CSS (.wall__col is flex:1 1 0) and no legibility floor, and it
// buys back more than the correction took.
//
// Each rung carries BOTH halves of its own bargain: `css` is the --well-* scale
// it renders at (main.css holds the top rung as its defaults), and the rest is
// that scale browser-measured — `chars` the alert copy that fits one line at
// this size in a column of this count, `line` the line box, `para` the gap
