// Content-aware layout generation: fit the board to the data the user asked for.
//
// Every other add surface in this app places a newly checked widget at its
// hard-coded MIN_SIZE in the first free slot, top-left first. That is why a
// freshly set-up board is a pile of minimum-size cards with holes between them,
// and why a user who picks 11 tube lines sees two of them behind a "+9" badge.
// The blank space and the +N badges are the same bug seen from two sides.
//
//   optimizeLayout(ids, cfg) -> { layout, dropped, crowded, plan, metrics }
//
// Pure, side-effect free and deterministic: the same ids and the same cfg give a
// byte-identical layout, independent of the order the ids arrive in. No Date, no
// random, no DOM, no network — so /setup can re-run it on every checkbox change
// and a test can pin the output.
//
// SHAPE OF THE ALGORITHM
//   The board is 12 columns x 8 rows. Content demand is a HEIGHT question only —
//   every capacity model in capacity.js is a function of h alone, width never
//   enters it (asserted in test/layout-optimize.test.js). So the generator picks
//   a column structure, drops each card into a column, then spends the 8 rows of
//   each column on whatever those rows buy the most of.
//
//     1  column plan   enumerate splits of the 12 columns into 2..6 columns
//     2  assign        reading order, group-major, left to right
//     3  absorb        every column should own something that can eat spare rows
//     4  fill          award rows in RUNS to whoever buys the most per row
//     5  repair        first-improvement local search (move / swap between
//                      columns) against the objective in scoreOf
//     6  score         fewest unplaced -> fewest blank cells -> fewest broken
//                      promises -> most content value -> calmest columns
//
// SCOPE (v1, 2026-07-29): this drives /setup's layout generation only. The board's
// own edit-mode tray and the Settings widget toggles keep their firstFitAny
// behaviour on purpose — a user editing a board they arranged by hand should not
// have it silently reflowed under them. Quick Start keeps its hand-arranged
// showcase, which already tiles all 96 cells.

// The demand model: one question per widget — "how much card does this user's
// configuration actually need, and what is a bigger card worth?"
//
//   kind
//     'exact'   the list length is knowable from cfg. Truncation is a broken
//               promise ("I picked 4 teams and see 2"). Past the height that
//               shows the whole list a taller card only adds dead air, which is
//               the reason layout.js already carries CONTENT_CAPPED.
//     'elastic' an open-ended feed. `target` is the useful minimum; `feed` is
//               where more rows stop buying data (every rail feed slices to 12).
//     'canvas'  no list: a picture, a single fact, a chart. Worth its AREA, plus
//               a bonus for each renderer tier it reaches.
//
//   tiers     {h: bonus} — a real behaviour change in the renderer at that
//             height, cited to the file. Absolute: reaching a tier is worth the
//             same at any width.
//   soft      above this height extra area is nearly worthless (a taller Quote
//             of the Day is just bigger type) but still better than a hole.
//   widthTier [w, bonus] — a real behaviour change at that WIDTH.
//   trim      rows this card will lose that no static table can predict — a
//             number, or a function of cfg. Two causes, both measured in the
//             browser on 2026-07-29 and both genuinely unknowable up front:
//             a renderer that measures its drawn box and sheds trailing rows to
//             the +N badge (subway, services), and a service alert banner that
//             the .train boards subtract from their own capacity when the live
//             feed happens to carry one. Discount rather than spend the board on
//             a promise the browser will quietly break.
//   shape     [w, minH] — a card this wide needs at least this many rows or its
//             body clips. Measured, not guessed.
//
// Every citation here was re-checked against the live widget file on 2026-07-29.
// The tier heights are the one thing that drifts: if you change a renderer's
// size branches, fix the row here in the same commit.
