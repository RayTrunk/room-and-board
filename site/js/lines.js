// Official line colors for the LIRR, Metro-North and NJ Transit departure
// boards. A row's line name renders as a filled signage chip in the agency's
// own color, which is what makes it read as the LINE at a glance — as plain dim
// text it just looked like a repeat of the destination above it ("Babylon ·
// 8:46 PM" under "Babylon"). Keys are the strings the widgets already carry
// (lirr.js ROUTE_NAMES + TT_BRANCH_NAMES, mnr.js ROUTE_NAMES, and for NJT the
// verbatim feed LINE value, which config.js NJT_LINES already pins), so the
// table is a straight lookup with no extra mapping layer.
//
// `ink` is stored per line rather than derived at render time: it's a
// legibility call on the exact hue, and one table beats luminance math running
// once per row per minute. test/transit.test.js gates every pair at the 4.5:1
// AA floor (New Haven red is the one documented exception — see there).
//
// `label` is the optional short chip text, for the same reason `ink` is stored:
// data, not cleverness. NJT's feed names are long enough to crowd a 3-wide card
// ("Northeast Corridor Line · 8:46 PM"), and the drop is a suffix strip for
// five of the six and a whole word for the sixth — so it's written out per line
// instead of regex-guessed. Entries without a `label` show their key, which is
// every MTA line, unchanged.
